## Project Setup

1. [Join the the `#p1-js-exercises` Slack channel][1] and click the link and accept the `p1-js-exercises` assignment on Github.
1. Head over to glitch.com and create a new `hello-webpage` project. Open the glitch project for editing
1. Click the name of your glitch project in the upper left and choose `advanced options` from the dropdown
    1. If the Import from Github button is greyed out, click the `grant access` link
    1. Click the `Authorize FogCreek` button to give Glitch access to your Github
1. Click the `Import from Github` button
1. In the popup, type `ITP-175-FA18/p1-` followed by your github username and click OK.
1. After your project has been imported from github, you will see `exercise1.js`, `exercise2.js`, etc in the files list on the left.

## Working on the project

Now you can begin work on this project. This project contains 2 identical exercises, one working with arrays and the other with objects.

1. Click the `exercise1.js` file to open it and see the instructions.
1. Click the `Show Live` button near the upper left on Glitch. This will open a new tab with your app.
1. Select exercise1.html and you'll see instructions for opening your browser console. Follow them and open your browser console.
1. As you edit code in Glitch, this live view of your app will auto-refresh and run your latest code. Switch back and forth between the Glitch Editor and the Live View to see if the output of your programs is what you expect.

After completing the exercises, you're ready to move onto submission.

## Project Submission

1. Click the name of your glitch project in the upper left and choose `advanced options` from the dropdown
1. Click the `Export to Github` button
1. In the popup, type `ITP-175-FA18/p1-` followed by your github username if it is not already there and click OK
1. Type in a Commit message and click ok. You should see an `export successful` message on the right side of the screen.
1. Visit github.com/ITP-175-FA18/p1-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME and if you see a yellow box saying `glitch` on the left and a green `Compare and pull request` button on the right, Glitch successfully exported and you're done.
